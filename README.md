This project is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and practical skills necessary to work with databases effectively.

The journey begins with understanding what a database is, the different types of databases, and an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language). Youâ€™ll explore essential SQL operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations) and advance to more sophisticated SQL techniques.
